# Pipeline Canvas

Pipeline Canvas is a visual workflow builder for connecting and experimenting with different data processing nodes. It lets you drag, drop, and link together components like APIs, databases, LLMs, and text processors to create custom pipelinesâ€”all in your browser.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop interface for building pipelines
- Modular nodes: API, database, LLM, text, and more
- Real-time editing and configuration of each node
- Visual feedback for connections and data flow
- Easy to extend with new node types

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for the frontend)
- Python 3 (for the backend)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kayjayy22/pipeline-canvas.git
   cd pipeline-canvas
   ```

2. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the React app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Backend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If requirements.txt exists
   python main.py
   ```
   The backend will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default.
